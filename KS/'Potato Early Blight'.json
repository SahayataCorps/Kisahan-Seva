	"intro": "Alternaria solani is a fungal pathogen, that produces a disease in tomato and potato plants called early blight. The pathogen produces distinctive 'bullseye' patterned leaf spots and can also cause stem lesions and fruit rot on tomato and tuber blight on potato.",
	"symps": "It is present in both hills & plains. Brown-black necrotic spot-angular, oval shape characterized by concentric rings .Several spot coalesce & spread all over the leaf. Shot holes on fruits.</p><h4>Pathogen</h4><p>Hyphae are light brown or olivaceous which become dark coloured with age. The hyphae are branched, septate and inter and intra cellular. The coniophores emerge through the stomata or between the epidermal cells. The conidia are club shaped with a long beak which is often half the long of the whole conidium. The lower part of the conidium is brown while the neck is colorless. The body of the conidium is divided by 5 – 10 transverse septa and there may or may not be a few longitudinal septa. </p><h2>Favourable condition</h2><p> Dry warm weather with intermittent rain .Poor vigor. Temperature: 25-30°C. Poorly manured crop.</p>",
	"dm": "Disease free seed tubers should be used for planting. Removal and destruction of infected plant debris should be done because the spores lying in the soil are the primary source of infection. Very early spraying with Zineb or captan 0.2% and repeating it for every 15 – 20 days gives effective control. The variety Kufri Sindhuri possesses a fair degree of resistance. "
