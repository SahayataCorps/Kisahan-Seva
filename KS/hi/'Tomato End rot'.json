	"intro":"Blossom end rot is a troublesome disease, familiar to most gardeners who have grown tomatoes. The disease is often prevalent in commercial as well as home garden tomatoes, and severe losses may occur if preventive control measures are not undertaken.",
	"symps": "A water-soaked spot at the blossom end of tomato fruits is the classic symptom of blossom-end rot. This relatively common garden problem is not a disease, but rather a physiological disorder caused by a calcium imbalance within the plant. It can occur in pepper, squash, cucumber, and melon fruits as well as tomatoes.</p><p>Blossom-end rot is most common when the growing season starts out wet and then becomes dry when fruit is setting. Damage first appears when fruits are approximately half their full size. The water-soaked areas enlarge and turn dark brown and leathery. These areas will eventually begin to rot, so the fruit should be picked and discarded. </p><h2>Favourable Condition</h2><p>Low soil calcium levels and an improper pH level may cause blossom-end rot if environmental conditions are favorable.",

When the weather is dry, water thoroughly once or twice each week to moisten the soil to a depth of at least 6 inches.<br>Prevent calcium deficiency with Tomato Rot Stop.<br>In cold climates, allow soil to warm before planting; cold soils limit nutrient uptake.<br>In cold climates, allow soil to warm before planting; cold soils limit nutrient uptake.<br>Use fertilizers that are low in nitrogen and high in phosphorous, such as our GSC Organic Tomato Fertilizer.<br>Apply mulch, such as Red Tomato Mulch, to minimize evaporation and help maintain consistent soil moisture."
