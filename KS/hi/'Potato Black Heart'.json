	"intro":"Blackheart is an internal defect caused by low oxygen and high carbon dioxide levels in the tuber and occurs where the respiration demand for oxygen exceeds the available supply. This might be due to low oxygen levels in the environment, such as field flooding, or high tuber respiration rates, usually in response to temperature extremes. Crops are most vulnerable around harvest time where respiration rates are likely to be higher.",
	"symps":"Black heart occurs primarily in storage when the tubers do not receive enough oxygen.<br>Blackening of the tuber center follows acute oxygen deficiency associated with either low temperature in confined storage or high field soil temperatures.<br>The tissue dies from the inside out and turns jet black. Smell is absent.<br>Affected tubers rot later.",
	"dm":"Plant fruit that is afflicted by either blossom-end rot or blackheart should be picked and discarded, leaving the healthy fruit on the plant. While the condition is not contagious and it will not spread from fruit to fruit, removing affected fruit will enable the plant to concentrate strength towards the healthier parts of the plant. Additional water should be added to a plant suffering from the effects of a hot, dry spell. If low calcium in the soil is the cause, this can be treated with calcium-rich fertilizers, such as gypsum, limestone, or ground eggshells."
