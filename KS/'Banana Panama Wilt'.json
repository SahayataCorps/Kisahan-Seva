	"intro": "Brown spot has been historically largely ignored as one of the most common and most damaging rice diseases.",
	"symps": "The fungus attacks the crop from seedling to milky stage in main field. Symptoms appear as minute spots on the coleoptile, leaf blade, leaf sheath, and glume, being most prominent on the leaf blade and glumes.<br>The spots become cylindrical or oval, dark brown with yellow halo later becoming circular. Several spots coalesce and the leaf dries up. The seedlings die and affected nurseries can be often recognised from a distance by scorched appearance. Dark brown or black spots also appear on glumes leading to grain discoloration. It causes failure of seed germination, seedling mortality and reduces the grain quality and weight<br>Favrable Condition<br>Temperature of 25-30ËšC with relative humidity above 80 per cent are highly favourable.<br>Excess of nitrogen aggravates the disease severity.",
	"dm": "Field sanitation-removal of collateral hosts and infected debris from the field.<br>Use of slow release nitrogenous fertilizers is advisable.<br><br>TGrow tolerant varieties viz., Co44 and Bhavani. Use disease free seeds.<br><br>Treat the seeds with Thiram or Captan at 4 g/kg. Spray the nursery with Edifenphos 40 ml or Mancozeb 80 g for 20 cent nursery.<br><br>Spray the crop in the main field with Edifenphos 500 ml or Mancozeb 2 kg/ha when grade reaches 3. If needed repeat after 15 days. "
