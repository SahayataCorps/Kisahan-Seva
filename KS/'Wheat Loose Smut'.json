	"intro":"Loose smut of barley is caused by Ustilago nuda.It is a disease that can destroy a large proportion of a barley crop. Loose smut replaces grain heads with smut, or masses of spores which infect the open flowers of healthy plants and grow into the seed, without showing any symptoms. Seeds appear healthy and only when they reach maturity the following season is it clear that they were infected. Systemic fungicides are the major control method for loose smut.",
	"symps":"It is very difficult to detect infected plants in the field until heading. At this time, infected heads emerge earlier than normal heads. The entire inflorescence is commonly affected and appears as a mass of olive-black spores, initially covered by a thin gray membrane. Once the membrane ruptures, the head appears powdery.<br><br>Spores are dislodged, leaving only the rachis intact. In some cases remnants of glumes and awns may be present on the exposed rachis. Smutted heads are shorter than healthy heads due to a reduction in the length of the rachis and peduncle. All or a portion of the heads on an infected plant may exhibit these symptoms. While infected heads are shorter, the rest of the plant is slightly taller than healthy plants. Prior to heading affected plants have dark green erect leaves. Chlorotic streaks may also be visible on the leaves.",
	"dm": "Treat the seed with Vitavax @ 2g/kg seed before sowing. Burry the infected ear heads in the soil, so that secondary spread is avoided."
